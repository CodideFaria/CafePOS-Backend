## Comprehensive Project Report: CafePOS-Backend

**1. Project Overview & Vision**

*   **Project Name:** CafePOS Async â€“ Tornado & React Edition (Product Name: CafePOS)
*   **Goal:** To develop a modern, Python 3.13-powered point-of-sale system for independent coffee shops, enabling order processing, thermal receipt printing, and real-time inventory tracking.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python 3.13 (Tornado 6.5), PostgreSQL 17, React 19 with Tailwind CSS 4.
*   **Timeline:** Five 2-week sprints, aiming for completion by August 30, 2025.
*   **MVP Scope:** Focus on core functionalities: order entry, payment, receipt printing, and basic inventory. Explicitly excludes integrated card processing, multi-branch sync, and advanced fiscal printing for the MVP.

**2. Current Project Structure Analysis**

Based on the provided folder structure, the project has a well-defined backend architecture:

*   **`main.py`**: Likely the main entry point for the Tornado application.
*   **`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`**: Indicates a Dockerized development and deployment setup, aligning with the "Project Setup & DevOps" epic.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies.
*   **`pytest.ini`, `tests/`**: Presence of `pytest.ini` and a `tests` directory with various `test_*.py` files (e.g., `test_inventory.py`, `test_main.py`, `test_menu_items.py`, `test_orders.py`, `test_roles.py`, `test_users.py`) suggests that a testing framework (pytest) is set up and unit/integration tests are being written, which aligns with the "Define testing strategy" epic.
*   **`apis/`**: Contains API handlers for different modules (`alerts_api.py`, `inventory_api.py`, `menu_api.py`, `order_items_api.py`, `orders_api.py`, `roles_api.py`, `users_api.py`). This indicates that the core API endpoints for various functionalities are being developed.
*   **`orm/`**: Contains `base.py` (likely SQLAlchemy base for models), `db_init.py` (database initialization), `controllers/` (business logic for each module), and `models/` (database models). This confirms the use of an ORM (likely SQLAlchemy given the Python context) and a clear separation of concerns for database interaction and business logic.
*   **`.github/workflows/main.yml`**: Suggests a CI/CD pipeline is being set up using GitHub Actions, which aligns with the "Set up Git repository & CI/CD pipeline" epic.
*   **`seed.py`**: A script for seeding the database, as mentioned in the "Seed staging database with demo menu data" task.

**3. What is Done (Based on File Presence & Jira Statuses)**

*   **Project Setup & DevOps (SCRUM-2 Epic):**
    *   **Docker Environment:** `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are present, indicating the setup of the local development environment.
    *   **CI/CD Setup:** `.github/workflows/main.yml` exists, suggesting that GitHub Actions are being configured.
    *   **Git Repository Initialization:** `SCRUM-8` ("Initialize GitHub repository & connect to Jira") is marked "In Progress," implying this is largely done or underway.
    *   **Database Seeding:** `seed.py` is present for seeding the database.
*   **Core Backend Structure:**
    *   The `apis/` and `orm/` directories are well-structured with modules for `alerts`, `inventory`, `menu`, `order_items`, `orders`, `roles`, and `users`, indicating that the foundational code for these functionalities is in place.
    *   `db_init.py` suggests database initialization logic is handled.
*   **Testing Framework:** `pytest.ini` and the `tests/` directory confirm that a testing framework is integrated.

**5. Summary of Progress**

The project has a solid foundational structure in place, with clear architectural separation for APIs, ORM, and models. The development environment is being set up with Docker, and a testing framework is integrated. However, based on the Jira tickets, a significant portion of the core features and project management tasks are still in the "To Do" or "In Progress" state. The documentation provides a clear roadmap and technical justification, which is a strong asset.

**6. Next Steps / Recommendations**

1.  **Prioritize Jira Tasks:** Focus on completing the "To Do" tasks within the current sprint's scope, especially those related to the core MVP (Menu & Pricing, Sales Workflow, Receipt Printing, and Inventory).
2.  **Complete DevOps Setup:** Ensure the CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and documented, and the Docker Compose environment is robust.
3.  **Implement Core Features:** Begin implementing the functionalities outlined in the "Menu & Pricing / Sales Workflow" and "Receipt Printing & Inventory" epics, as these are central to the MVP.
4.  **Address Security & Reporting:** Start working on the security and reporting features as they are critical for a production system.
5.  **Regular Reviews:** Continue with sprint reviews and retrospectives as planned in the documentation to ensure continuous feedback and improvement.
